81	https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-case-updates-xrp-price-action-shiba-inu-shib-milestones-bits-recap-sep-12/	The SEC's former appeal, XRP's price decline, and Shibarium's 2 million daily transactions are among the things worth observing.	Ripple v SEC Case Updates, XRP Price Action, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Milestones: Bits Recap Sep 12	2023-09-12	<p><span>The crypto community has witnessed plenty of developments regarding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, price fluctuations of XRP, and major milestones that Shiba Inu reached in the past few days.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the following lines, we will take a closer look at the most recent actions surrounding those topics.</span></p>\n<h2><span>The Ripple v SEC Case</span></h2>\n<p><span>The legal battle between the blockchain enterprise and America&#8217;s securities regulator has been ongoing since 2020. While both sides were scoring small victories throughout the years, Ripple seems to have the upper hand after the US magistrates ruled in mid-July that most of its XRP sales did not constitute an offer of unregistered securities.</span></p>\n<p><div class="embed"></div></p>\n<p><span>The court&#8217;s decision resulted in an overall revival of the cryptocurrency market and enhanced optimism among the community that a decisive win is just around the corner. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, the SEC was unhappy, to say the least, and formally </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-regulator-strikes-back-sec-files-to-appeal-ripples-partial-court-victory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>appealed</span></a><span> the ruling last weekend. Specifically, the Commission&#8217;s disagreement is focused on two particular sales &#8211; &#8220;programmatic&#8221; (which were offered to public buyers) and such classified by the court as &#8220;other distributions.&#8221; Judge Torres has already determined that the former did not violate securities laws.</span></p>\n<p><span>The crypto community closely follows the lawsuit since its outcome could have an impact on the entire sector. In addition, thousands of XRP investors are directly involved in it.</span></p>\n<p><span>John Deaton &#8211; a pro-Ripple attorney representing 75,000 of them &#8211; recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/riple-v-sec-lawsuit-where-are-the-xrp-holders-mostly-from-lawyer-breaks-it-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stated</span></a><span> that 53% of the people are situated in the United States. The United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and Canada round up the top four destinations. </span></p>\n<h2><span>XRP&#8217;s Price Fluctuations</span></h2>\n<p><span>The native token of Ripple has been among the most volatile cryptocurrencies in the past few months. Its price </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>skyrocketed</span></a><span> by over 70% in July when a US Judge ruled that the sale of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute an offer of investment contracts. </span></p>\n<p><span>The rally continued until July 20, before the valuation started plunging. The SEC&#8217;s appeal on the lawsuit&#8217;s decision has also affected XRP, which currently trades at approximately $0.47 (per CoinMarketCap&#8217;s data), or a 44% decline compared to the figure registered after the partial court victory.</span></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly, the coin&#8217;s price continues to struggle despite some important developments surrounding Ripple. For one, the enterprise acquired Fortress Trust &#8211; a prominent financial institution focused on digital currencies. As reported by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Ripple </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-helps-fortress-customers-recover-funds-as-part-of-acquisition-deal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>recovered</span></a><span> funds for some of the company&#8217;s customers (previously affected by a security incident) as part of the deal.</span></p>\n<p><span>Last but not least, the overall trading volume of XRP throughout the past 24 hours </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/important-xrp-metric-skyrockets-140-in-a-day-but-ripple-price-suffers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>recorded</span></a><span> a 140% increase, currently sitting at around $1.3 billion (according to CoinMarketCap).</span></p>\n<h2><span>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Milestones</span></h2>\n<p><span>The memecoin has been in the spotlight ever since its layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium, saw the light of day last month. Since then, daily transactions on the latter </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>surpassed</span></a><span> the 2 million mark, while wallet addresses currently stand at over 1.1 million.</span></p>\n<p><div class="embed"></div></p>\n<p><span>However, the price of Shiba Inu&#8217;s native token continues to struggle, being 32% down in the past month. Speaking of SHIB, it is worth mentioning that its burn rate </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-burn-rate-skyrockets-330-in-24-hours-details/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soared</span></a><span> above 330% a few days ago.</span></p>\n<p><span>Reducing the overall supply could be considered a bullish factor since it could potentially increase a coin&#8217;s value by making it more scarce and creating more demand.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-case-updates-xrp-price-action-shiba-inu-shib-milestones-bits-recap-sep-12/" rel="nofollow">Ripple v SEC Case Updates, XRP Price Action, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Milestones: Bits Recap Sep 12</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/" rel="nofollow">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>	40	\N	\N

On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, [&#8230;]	Bitcoin Spark and BNB: Why Bitcoin Spark Could Be the Next Big Thing	2023-09-12	<p>Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) is getting significant attention in the crypto space. Market observers suggest with Binance’s current situation, BTCS might be the next big thing, potentially challenging the dominance of Binance Coin (BNB).</p>\n<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-1.png"><img alt="Picture1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271845" height="351" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-1.png" width="624" /></a></p>\n<h2>Is Binance in Trouble?</h2>\n<p>On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that they worked to attract U.S. customers to its unregulated international exchange, commingled investor funds with their own and violated securities laws.</p>\n<p>The 13 charges came after the CFTC unveiled a similar complaint against Binance and Zhao in March. This litigation has had several negative effects on the Binance ecosystem. On August 31, the exchange stated its intention to gradually cease support for BUSD, its stablecoin, by February 2024.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Binance has seen the departure of 10 executives from various departments, with four top executives reportedly leaving the same day after Binance’s response to the United States Department of Justice investigation. While the exchange&#8217;s Zhao took to X (former Twitter) to address the growing speculations around the departure of the executives, and some of them insisted it&#8217;s routine, the crypto community has become a bit more skeptical about exchanges since the FTX collapse.</p>\n<h2>BNB Price Outlook</h2>\n<p>The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows a notable resistance level at $220, with analysts suggesting a potential rise to $250 if this level is reclaimed. However, analysts claim as long as BNB remains below $250, a bearish outlook persists, with a possible retest of $184. They point to the SEC lawsuit against Binance as a catalyst for this bearish move.</p>\n<h2>What is Bitcoin Spark, and Why Could it Be the Next Big Thing?</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark is a new crypto project that has been said to be <a href="https://youtu.be/bJiwcDHRS-Y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rewriting</a> Bitcoin&#8217;s history. It shares similarities with the original cryptocurrency, including having a capped supply of 21 million, but has made significant improvements to boost speed, security, scalability, and utility.</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin Spark blockchain assures faster and cheaper transactions owing to its enhanced individual block transaction capacity, low block time, and large number of nodes. It also offers a more scalable platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) by integrating a smart contract layer with different execution systems that reach finality on the main network. This enables developers to build using both high-level and low-level programming languages, promoting diversity.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark significantly extends its real-world applications by introducing decentralized CPU and GPU rental. The network uses a groundbreaking consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Process (PoP), which non-linearly rewards users for confirming blocks and contributing their processing power. Bitcoin Spark is incredibly lightweight, allowing even low-powered devices to run the network.</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s team will provide an application that enables users with Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS devices to participate in network validation by permitting access to their device&#8217;s processing unit. The app will ensure safety by working in an isolated virtual environment that doesn&#8217;t interfere with the device&#8217;s operating system functions. The application will also be able to adjust the processing power used to prevent overheating, conserve battery, and cater for concurrent device usage requirements.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture2-4.jpg"><img alt="btcspark" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271231" height="473" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture2-4.jpg" width="624" /></a></p>\n<p>The validators&#8217; collective power will then be &#8216;rented out&#8217; to organizations or individuals as remote computing power. Those needing the computational resources will pay using BTCS, and the revenue will be channeled to the network&#8217;s validators.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark will also include advertising services, with small slots for ads on its application and website. The ads will be policed by the community to ensure adherence to terms and conditions. Advertisers will pay using BTCS, and 50% of the revenue will go to network participants and the remaining to the team for development.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark&#8217;s relation to Bitcoin, innovative technology, and real-world applicability suggest it could try to become the next big thing in crypto. Some investors are taking advantage of the project&#8217;s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to buy BTCS at its current low market capitalization. BTCS will launch at $10 but is currently selling at $2.25 with a 10% in Phase 4 of the ICO.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The turmoil surrounding Binance has created an opening for promising contenders like Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) to step in and claim a larger share of the crypto market.</p>\n<p>For more on Bitcoin Spark:</p>\n<p>Website: <a href="https://bitcoinspark.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://bitcoinspark.org/</a></p>\n<p>Visit BTCS ICO: <a href="https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register</a></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it’s written by a third party.

XRP Emerges as an Outlier, While BTC Suffers $69M Outflows: CoinShares	2023-09-12	<p>The market remains in an &#8220;apathetic&#8221; state, with digital asset funds experiencing outflows totaling $59 million last week, bringing the total outflows in this streak to $294 million. This represented 0.9% of total assets under management (AuM).</p>\n<p>Digital asset manager Coinshares attributed these movements primarily to ongoing concerns about the regulatory environment for the asset class and the recent strength of the dollar. Additionally, trading volumes saw a substantial decline, plummeting by 73% compared to the previous week, reaching just $754 million for the past seven days.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Bears the Brunt</h2>\n<p>According to the latest <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-148-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-5dff6669b7d3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">edition</a> of CoinShares&#8217; Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, the sentiment remains poor, as evidenced by inflows seen in short investment products during the same period.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin took the hardest hit, recording $69 million in outflows in last week. On the other hand, short-Bitcoin investments experienced their most significant weekly influx since March 2023, amounting to $15 million. CoinShares pointed out that this timing aligns with the increased regulatory uncertainty seen in March when similar inflows occurred.</p>\n<p>Ethereum did not escape the negative sentiment either, registering outflows amounting to $4.8 million. This extends the year-to-date outflows to $108 million, accounting for 1.6% of Assets under Management (AuM), marking it as the least favored digital asset among ETP investors this year.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, blockchain equities also witnessed outflows of $10.8 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of outflows in this sector.</p>\n<h2>XRP Investment Products Sees Inflows</h2>\n<p>In an earlier report, <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-gains-inflows-amidst-apathetic-market-condition-coinshares/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that interest in altcoins may have diminished significantly in recent weeks as high-profile investors pulled cash out of funds.</p>\n<p>Despite the increased negative sentiment, XRP emerged as an outlier. The landmark court victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could still be a major catalyst in capturing investors even as the XRP&#8217;s price trajectory has been a roller coaster since the ruling.</p>\n<p>In fact, investment products tied to the crypto-asset continued to attract inflows, with a total of $0.7 million recorded last week. XRP also showed encouraging movements, amassing a net inflow of $0.5 million during the week ending on August 25th.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-emerges-as-an-outlier-while-btc-suffers-69m-outflows-coinshares/" rel="nofollow">XRP Emerges as an Outlier, While BTC Suffers $69M Outflows: CoinShares</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/" rel="nofollow">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>	42	\N	\N

The memecoin era of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu increased this buzz and excitement. These meme coins gained attention, and one question gets on our screens regularly: Is Dogecoin a good investment?</p>\n<p>In this piece, we will examine this subject and a fascinating alternative, Bitcoin Spark (BTCS), which wants to change the mining scene.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/memecoins_btcspark_cover.jpg"><img alt="memecoins_btcspark_cover" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272219" height="720" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/memecoins_btcspark_cover.jpg" width="1201" /></a></p>\n<h2>The Dangers of Memecoins</h2>\n<p>Meme coins frequently capture people&#8217;s interest, particularly that of investors, due to their amusing branding, celebrity support, and promises of enormous profit. The beauty of meme coins lies in their accessibility and potential for significant gains.</p>\n<p>They are not expensive, making them a good choice for beginner investors. The buzz it creates around social media is enough to make you get the FOMO (Fear of Missing out) effect, luring more investors into the memecoin world.</p>\n<p>But here is the catch: meme coins like Dogecoin lack primary value. They were made as jokes and did not offer any form of utility or purpose like established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum. Investing in meme coins is not a friendly ride; you&#8217;ll experience wild price swings and constant uncertainty about their price.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an alternative to meme coins: a new player in the block set to stir up waves and transform the blockchain space.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Spark: A Game-Changing Alternative</h2>\n<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ETF0UQ1dSnM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Spark</a> (BTCS) is a notable hard fork that uses the Proof of Process blockchain technology to reshape the Bitcoin mining landscape. This alternative to meme coins offers a more innovative approach to addressing the challenge of the cryptocurrency world, making it a compelling choice for investors looking for a more accessible and rewarding mining experience. It isn’t just a coin; it is an innovative technology with significant features useful in the crypto space.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark also addresses the issue of scalability and transaction fees, which is a significant concern in the cryptocurrency space.</p>\n<h2>A User-Friendly Mining Experience with Bitcoin Spark</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Spark provides programs to help with mining and reward distribution. The BTCS Application delivers a user-friendly interface that allows users to engage in the mining process easily. You may help the network by contributing processing power. Your rewards will be dependent on your investment in the network and the amount of processing power you offer. This method allows you to interact with the BTCS network according to your preferences and capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are short-term investments and do not necessarily provide much value to the blockchain ecosystem or address significant concerns. On the other hand, Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) is creating a name for itself by addressing the issues of mining, scalability, and transaction fees through its innovative Proof of Process consensus mechanism. Bitcoin Spark&#8217;s user-friendly program facilitates mining and compensates contributors.</p>\n<p>Consider Bitcoin Spark, a new option in the Bitcoin industry. While meme coins have their place, BTCS addresses significant issues, potentially redefining the future of mining.</p>\n<p>To know more about Bitcoin Spark:</p>\n<p>Website: <a href="https://bitcoinspark.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://bitcoinspark.org/</a></p>\n<p>Visit BTCS presale: <a href="https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register</a></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it’s written by a third party.

Almost $200 Million Liquidated Amid Bitcoin’s Rollercoaster: Market Watch	2023-09-12	<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price finally made a few volatile moves that resulted in dumping to a new two-month low before recovering all losses in hours.</p>\n<p>Most altcoins went through something similar, but quite a few of them are still in the red on a daily scale, including ETH, XRP, DOGE, LEON, and many others.</p>\n<h2>BTC&#8217;s Dump and Pump</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price was quite sluggish for about a week, which it spent trading in a tight range just below $26,000. The only exception came last Friday morning when it pumped to a multi-day high of $26,400. However, that was short-lived, and the bears pushed it south once more to its previous trading ground.</p>\n<p>The weekend was expectedly uneventful, but the landscape was prompted to change amid speculations about upcoming sell-offs from FTX. Such a change indeed transpired yesterday evening when BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dips-below-25k-ripple-xrp-plummets-5-daily-as-market-pulls-back/">slumped</a> by about a grand to a two-month low of just under $25,000.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency bounced off rather quickly and neared $26,000 once again minutes ago. As of now, the asset remains inches below that level. Its market cap has reclaimed the $500 billion mark, while its dominance over the alts has soared to 49% as most alts have underperformed.</p>\n<p>The enhanced volatility has harmed over-leveraged traders, as the total amount of liquidations has skyrocketed to nearly $200 million on a daily scale, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGlass.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_272178" style="width: 1835px;"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BTCUSD-8.png"><img alt="BTCUSD.

LEO has dumped even more, having lost almost 5% of its value overnight.</p>\n<p>Optimism&#8217;s native token is among the few exceptions. OP is well in the green, having soared by about 7% in the past 24 hours.

Important XRP Metric Skyrockets 140% in a Day but Ripple Price Suffers	2023-09-12	<p>The past 24 hours saw the cryptocurrency market dip. While some coins managed to recover, Ripple&#8217;s XRP was unfortunately not one of them.</p>\n<p>XRP&#8217;s price tumbled from above $0.49 to around $0.47 (where it&#8217;s currently trading) alongside most of the other altcoins during yesterday&#8217;s trading session. This followed Bitcoin&#8217;s price decline, which dipped below $25K before recovering to where it&#8217;s currently at almost $26K. While BTC was able to erase most of the losses in a classic Bart-chart price action, XRP failed to do so.</p>\n<p>The uptick in volatility has also been reflected in the overall trading volume for XRP throughout the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, it now sits at around $1.3 billion, which is an increase of over 140% in the past day.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Ripple recently acquired Fortress Trust &#8211; a well-known financial institution that&#8217;s primarily focused on cryptocurrencies. Without disclosing any particular details of the deal, it was made public that Ripple had <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-helps-fortress-customers-recover-funds-as-part-of-acquisition-deal/">made</a> 4 of Fortress Trust&#8217;s customers whole for losses they suffered in a security breach. A Ripple spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Luckily, Ripple was in a position to act quickly to step in and make customers whole, and there have been no breaches to Fortress technology or system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The total sum of the acquisition remains unknown, and Ripple has made it clear that it plans to continue investing in the parent company of Fortress Trust once the acquisition goes through.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;ve also asked ChatGPT on its thoughts regarding Ripple&#8217;s performance during the next bull market.

Those who entered during the last bull market may well be underwater now that the asset has retreated 63% from its peak.</p>\n<p>It noted that realized value <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/on-chain-and-exchange-volumes-for-btc-eth-slide-in-august-sept-likely-to-repeat/">settled on-chain</a> remains extremely quiet. There is minimal profit or loss being locked in by the market overall, which means most of the coins are transacting close to their original acquisition price.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Realized Profit and Loss are similarly at levels equivalent to the 2020 market, highlighting what is arguably a complete and total wash-out of the exuberance from the 2021 bull market.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the supply held by long-term holders has reached a new all-time high 14.74 million BTC. Conversely, the short-term holder supply, which is more active, has fallen to its lowest level since 2011 at 2.46 million BTC.</p>\n<p>Regulatory concerns are still a looming shadow over the crypto industry. Until there is clarity, especially in the United States, big players and institutions may take a wait-and-see approach.</p>\n<p>Moreover, FTX may be given the green light to start <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-ftx-token-selloff-this-week-cause-a-solana-sol-crash/">selling its crypto holdings</a> on Sept. 13, and it has a lot of them.

He said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">&#8220;Given this industry&#8217;s wide-ranging noncompliance with securities laws, it&#8217;s not surprising we&#8217;ve seen many problems,&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">However, the crypto industry has argued that sweeping regulations fail to account for the unique nature of digital assets.</p>\n<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Others have <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coincenter-other-advocacy-groups-condemn-cansee-bill-for-overreach-on-defi/">accused</a> the SEC of overreach in attempting to stretch decades-old securities laws to emerging crypto finance models like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.</p>\n<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">However, Gensler&#8217;s strict regulatory approach faces ongoing legal challenges that may undermine the SEC&#8217;s ability to bring crypto firms into compliance. The recent court ruling in the Ripple case delivered a partial victory to the company, judging that some XRP token sales did not constitute unregistered securities.</p>\n<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Specifically, the judge determined retail sales and free distributions of XRP did not meet the legal test for securities. While declaring Ripple&#8217;s institutional sales were securities offerings, the nuanced ruling suggests crypto assets may not fit neatly into 1930s-era regulations. Some industry experts argue this shows gaps in the SEC&#8217;s conceptual approach to crypto finance. Nevertheless, Gensler expressed disappointment, and the SEC has since challenged the judge&#8217;s conclusions on retail XRP sales.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/despite-industry-objections-secs-gensler-holds-continues-to-classify-crypto-as-securities/" rel="nofollow">Despite industry objections, SEC&#8217;s Gensler continues to classify crypto as securities</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com" rel="nofollow">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>	47	\N	\N

Potential jurors are queried about any negative opinions they might hold regarding accumulating wealth with the intent to support global improvement or aid others and whether their views on Effective Altruism could affect their impartiality.</p>\n<p>The first set of questions around altruism may not only gauge the jurors&#8217; attitudes towards this philosophy but also subtly plant the idea that SBF is a person who is dedicated to using his <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ftx-attempting-to-recover-millions-donated-to-charities/">wealth for good</a>. This may potentially contrast with the image of a fraudulent CEO. Moreover, if any jurors are familiar with or sympathetic to Effective Altruism, they might be more prone to perceive SBF positively.</p>\n<h2>Political Donations.</h2>\n<p>Similarly, jurors&#8217; perspectives on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-fraudulent-campaign-donations-exceeding-100m/">political donations</a> and lobbying, substantial contributions to political candidates or lobbying groups, and the ethics of using these donations to advance personal interests are probed. These questions hint at SBF&#8217;s engagement in such practices, a common occurrence in the tech and financial sectors, and their role in his defense strategy.</p>\n<p>These questions might be preparing the ground for a defense strategy that contextualizes any large political donations or lobbying efforts by SBF. The defense could argue that they were made in good faith to support causes SBF believed in rather than for nefarious purposes. They can better tailor their defense arguments by ascertaining the jurors&#8217; attitudes.</p>\n<h2>&#8216;Never&#8217; used crypto.</h2>\n<p>Furthermore, potential jurors&#8217; stance on cryptocurrencies is investigated, with a specific emphasis on their personal involvement, or lack thereof, with crypto assets. The wording of the questions is notable as it explicitly emphasizes the word &#8216;never.&#8217;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Please indicate if you <em>never</em> have, or would <em>never</em>, buy, sell, or transact in any way in cryptocurrencies or crypto assets?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>By asking these questions, SBF&#8217;s defense could be trying to identify whether the jurors have any preconceived negative opinions about the crypto industry. This could reveal any bias, given that people unfamiliar with or hostile towards cryptocurrencies might be more prone to believe in fraudulent activities in this industry.</p>\n<p>The question about transacting in cryptocurrencies might also be used to identify jurors who understand cryptocurrency investments&#8217; volatility and inherent risks. These could be factors in the defense arguments.</p>\n<h2>Right to not testify.</h2>\n<p>Finally, the voir dire questions underline the legal right of a defendant not to testify in a criminal case, querying whether this would negatively influence jurors&#8217; perception of SBF.</p>\n<p>This question could be used to flush out any potential juror who might infer guilt from SBF&#8217;s silence. It is a constitutional right of a defendant not to testify, and any bias against this could be a potential ground for disqualification of a juror. Further, it opens the possibility that SBF will not testify during his trial.</p>\n<p>All of these questions not only serve to identify potential juror bias but also help SBF&#8217;s defense team strategize their arguments based on the responses.</p>\n<p>As the trial progresses, these proposed voir dire questions serve as a critical compass, revealist the bearings of the defense teandlso the multi-layered societal issues entwined with this high-profile crypto case. Irrespective of the trial&#8217;s outcome, its ramifications on future crypto regulations, political lobbying, and public discourse around wealth and altruism are poised to be substantial.</p>\n<p>SBF, the former CEO of the now-defunct FTX exchange, was handed eight counts of fraud and conspiracy charges in the United States over alleged misuse of FTX customer funds.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sbf-may-not-testify-in-court-as-lawyers-paint-altruist-picture-in-jury-questions/" rel="nofollow">SBF may not testify in court as lawyers paint &#8216;altruist&#8217; picture in jury questions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com" rel="nofollow">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>	47	\N	\N

Garnering over 60,000+ registered gamers since its November 2022 launch, the platform has carved a niche for itself as a hub for web3 gamers.</p>\n<p>Mechanism Capital partner Ken stressed the complexity of building web3 games and the infrastructure surrounding them, particularly for gaming hubs and aggregators, highlighting the importance of supporting platforms like GAM3S.GG.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/omar-ghanem/">Omar Ghanem</a>, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at GAM3S.GG, said that while web3 offered exciting possibilities, the absence of quality content and a one-stop destination for web3 gaming needs had left many gamers at a loss. His statement reflects the historical context of web3 gaming, which saw a play-to-earn craze in 2021 and 2022, as <em>CryptoSlate</em> <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/the-play-to-earn-craze-may-be-over-with-polkastarter-xborgs-entry-into-the-gaming-arena/#google_vignette">reported</a> at the time. However, the focus shifted to providing high-quality gameplay over playing to earn, a sentiment echoed by Ghanem and Daniel Stockhaus, another co-founder of Polkastarter.</p>\n<p>The shift in focus is validated by the platform&#8217;s curated content and its plans to build advanced features to make blockchain games more accessible. In December, GAM3S.GG hosted the first and largest web3 game award show &#8211; the GAM3 Awards, and now aims to introduce features like social logins, player-owned item management, and retrospective in-game progress tracking. The goal is to enable the direct playing of web3 games on the platform.</p>\n<p>With established gaming companies like Zynga and Ubisoft venturing into web3 gaming, the need for an aggregator like GAM3S.GG is escalating. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just curating; we&#8217;re spotlighting the top games, setting the gold standard, and allowing gamers to engage with games in unprecedented ways as we aim to become the definitive home of web3 gaming,” added Ghanem.</p>\n<p>Shreyansh Singh, Head of Investments at Polygon, praised GAM3S.GG for being a beacon of innovation in web3 gaming. Polygon, along with other investors like Double Peak, ArkStream Capital, and LD Capital, sees the platform as an accessible vision of web3, where quality games rise above the noise.</p>\n<h2>About GAM3S.GG</h2>\n<p>GAM3S.GG is a web3 gaming superapp that curates and creates content to spotlight the top games. It aims to become the one-stop-shop for web3 gaming to help onboard millions of gamers, offering unprecedented ways to engage with blockchain-powered games. The platform and its evolution underscore the growing significance of blockchain in the gaming industry.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="flex flex-col w-full max-w-5xl p-4 bg-white border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-sm flex-grow overflow-auto"></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/polkastarter-rebrands-to-gam3s-gg-after-successful-2m-funding-round/" rel="nofollow">Polkastarter rebrands to GAM3S.GG after successful $2M funding round</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com" rel="nofollow">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>	51	\N	\N

Their actions, often driven by experience and unwavering conviction in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s potential, have been a consistent feature in the market.</p>\n<p class="p1">However, a shift in the winds of the Bitcoin market has been observed over the past couple of years. Since the collapse of FTX, a new player has emerged on the scene with an increased appetite for accumulation: the Bitcoin shrimp. In this context, the term &#8220;shrimp&#8221; refers to addresses with balances of less than 1 BTC.</p>\n<p class="p1">The collapse of FTX marked a significant milestone for these shrimp. After the exchange&#8217;s crash, they added 85,000 BTC to their balances within a month. The previous high for shrimp accumulation was 53,000 BTC in 30 days, recorded in July 2022.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356486" style="width: 1800px;"><img alt="bitcoin shrimp accumulation balance" class="size-full wp-image-356486" height="1013" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shrimp-balance-jan-22-sep-23.png" width="1800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-356486">Graph showing the 30-day net position change in shrimp balances from January 2022 to September 2023 (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-entities-supply-shrimp-netposchange?s=1641264986&amp;u=1694441374&amp;zoom=">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class="p1">Between June and August, Bitcoin&#8217;s price oscillated in a constricted trading range of around $29,000. Their steady accumulation from shrimps continued, with an average monthly addition of 20,000 BTC to their balances. When Bitcoin&#8217;s price dropped to $25,000, the shrimp only intensified their accumulation activities.</p>\n<p class="p1">As of September 10, shrimp balances witnessed an addition of over 27,000 BTC in the preceding 30 days.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356487" style="width: 1800px;"><img alt="bitcoin shrimp balance" class="wp-image-356487 size-full" height="1013" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shrimp-balance-6mo.png" width="1800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-356487">Graph showing the 30-day net position change in shrimp balances from February to September 2023 (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-entities-supply-shrimp-netposchange?s=1678720539&amp;u=1694441739&amp;zoom=182">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class="p1">But it&#8217;s not just the accumulation of Bitcoin that&#8217;s noteworthy. The adoption rate, as evidenced by the creation of new shrimp addresses, has also seen a notable uptick. The number of addresses holding less than 1 BTC has surged this year. A record was set on May 25, with the creation of 1.89 million new shrimp addresses in 30 days.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356488" style="width: 1800px;"><img alt="shrimp accumulation address ytd" class="size-full wp-image-356488" height="1013" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shrimp-address-ytd.png" width="1800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-356488">Graph showing the 30-day net position change in new shrimp addresses YTD (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-address-count-shrimp?s=1672527600&amp;u=1694441448&amp;zoom=ytd">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class="p1">And even as Bitcoin&#8217;s price dipped to $25,000, the momentum remained unchanged. The 30-day period leading up to September 10 saw the creation of over 1 million new shrimp addresses.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356489" style="width: 1800px;"><img alt="shrimp address 3mo" class="size-full wp-image-356489" height="1013" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shrimp-address-3mo.png" width="1800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-356489">Graph showing the 30-day net position change in new shrimp addresses from July to September 2023 (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-address-count-shrimp?s=1686665860&amp;u=1694441860&amp;zoom=90">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class="p1">The shrimp&#8217;s aggressive accumulation patterns and rapid adoption rate signal a democratization of Bitcoin holdings. No longer is the market solely influenced by the actions of a few large holders. With their collective 1.35 million BTC balance, the shrimp are becoming a force to reckon with.</p>\n<p class="p1">This shift underscores a broader trend towards increased participation and further decentralization of the Bitcoin network, signaling a potential change in market influencers from major holders to smaller investors.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-shrimp-ramp-up-accumulation-singlaing-possible-shift-in-market/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin shrimp ramp up accumulation, signaling shift in market structure</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com" rel="nofollow">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>	52	\N	\N

This adds up to $294 million in outflows over the last four weeks, equating to 0.9% of the sector&#8217;s total assets under management (AUM).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, investors piled heavily into the short-Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) investment products. Per CoinShares, these products saw their single most significant inflow since March, with inflows worth $15 million.</p>\n<p>The negative sentiments become more pronounced when considering the trading volume of crypto investment products. According to the data, trading volumes dropped significantly by 73% to just $754 million from the $2.8 billion <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/2-8-billion-traded-in-digital-asset-etps-this-week-as-outflows-slow/">recorded</a> in the prior week.</p>\n<p>Speaking on this trend, CoinShares analyst James Butterfill said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Inflows [into] the short investment products suggests that sentiment remains poor for the asset class. We believe continued worries over regulation of the asset class and recent dollar strength are the most likely reasons for this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Bitcoin leads outflows</h2>\n<p class="s3">Per the report, Bitcoin took the most hit with outflows worth $69 million last week, bringing its month-to-date flows to $72.4 million.</p>\n<p>BTC investment products have been experiencing a bearish streak since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-etf-delay-pulls-market-back-leading-to-130-million-liquidation-havoc/">delayed</a> its decision on the avalanche of spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications before it. While Grayscale scored a pivotal victory that renewed hope of an SEC approval, investors have mainly remained cautious.</p>\n<p class="s3">Meanwhile, other assets like Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) and Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) recorded outflows of $4.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.</p>\n<p class="s3">This outflow brings ETH&#8217;s flows to a negative of $108m, representing 1.6% of Assets Under Management. CoinShares stated that this flow trend shows that ETH is the &#8220;least loved digital asset amongst ETP investors this year.&#8221;</p>\n<p class="s3">On the other hand, altcoins like XRP continue to record inflows, with last week&#8217;s flow reaching $700,000.</p>\n<p class="s3">Across countries, Germany took the most hit while Canada and the United States followed closely. Germany recorded $20 million in outflows, while Canada and the United States saw $17.6m and $12.3 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-outflows-on-the-rise-as-investors-bet-against-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">Crypto outflows on the rise as investors bet against Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com" rel="nofollow">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>	48	\N	\N

In the future, users will also be able to obtain this token through zUSDT and over-collateralization of ZIL.</p>\n<p>The decentralized exchange offers several functionalities to users, including the ability to trade between TYRON and S$I tokens, access to DeFi protocols, and a multi-DEX platform through which users can easily swap tokens on the Zilliqa network.</p>\n<p>Unlike other decentralized exchanges, TyronDEX leverages the unique sovereign identity features of the DAO’s SSI accounts, allowing users to create a sovereign identity account with expanded functionality such as social recovery, integrated non-custodial wallets, and NFT domain names.</p>\n<p>In addition, other wallets such as ZilPay can be used to connect directly with the TyronDEX interface if the user does not wish to create an SSI account.</p>\n<h4 id="what-is-tyrondex">What is TyronDEX?</h4>\n<p>TyronDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that combines familiar DeFi protocols and tools with the sovereign identity functionality of the Tyron SSI Protocol.</p>\n<p>Within the Tyron Network, self-sovereign identities (SSI) can interact with TyronDEX from their DeFi accounts using a simple and unified interface where they can choose from the best liquidity options, such as comparing the returns received from DragonDEX (ZilPay), ZilSwap (Switcheo), and Avely Swap (Avely) for the purchase and sale of stZIL.</p>\n<p>The DEX will support trading between ZIL and tokens such as TYRON, XSGD, zUSDT, ZWAP, stZIL, and ZLP. It also enables the exchange of XSGD for S$I, as well as S$I for TYRON, and vice versa.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“<em>The TyronDEX technology enables fair-launch IDOs with predetermined launch prices while allowing adjustments of variables such as token availability for the IDO. The first token to use this functionality is the TYRON token,” — <strong>Xalkan</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The fair-launch technology of TyronDEX also allows for fundraising to be conducted in Singapore dollars thanks to the parity between the SSI dollar and XSGD.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“TyronDEX differs from other DEXs on Zilliqa, which are based on the ZIL cryptocurrency, by presenting new opportunities through the Sovereign Identity Dollar stablecoin (SSI Dollar, S$I).” — <strong>Xalkan</strong> </em></p></blockquote>\n<h4 id="tyronsi-and-sovereign-identity-dollars">TyronS$I and sovereign identity dollars</h4>\n<p>In addition to its stablecoin offering, the SSI Dollar, TyronDEX also supports the new TyronS$I token, a liquidity pool token created by combining the existing TYRON token and the new SSI Dollar.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“With TyronS$I, users can participate in farming, use it as a means of payment, transfer it to other members of the TyronS$I DAO, redeem it for governance credits, and obtain S$I loans. “Furthermore, the multiDEX functionality enables increased liquidity in any of the DEXs integrated with TyronDEX, as well as staking and owning soulbound tokens. All of these funds are always protected by the TYRON social recovery mechanism, which is permissionless and decentralized.”— <strong>Xalkan</strong> </em></p></blockquote>\n<p>SSI Dollars can currently be created by burning TYRON tokens or locking XSGD, with the act of burning TYRON reducing the total supply of that token. Loans obtained through XSGD and zUSDT on TyronDEX are secured by non-custodial SSI vaults, and an annual fee is charged for managing these loans.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Users can use their S$I for providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges like TyronDEX, joining DAOs, governing and profit-sharing from communities like the TyronS$I DAO, and other DeFi applications. Additionally, S$I can be used for payments and peer-to-peer transfers with fiat currencies.”—<strong>Xalkan</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Users who choose to connect to TyronDEX using an SSI account will also have access to the platform’s expanded sovereign identity features, such as social recovery functionality, non-custodial digital identities, and DeFi wallets.</p>\n<h5>FOLLOW ZILLIQA</h5>\n<p><strong><a href="https://www.zilliqa.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zilliqa">Twitter</a></strong></p>\n<h5>FOLLOW TyronDEX</h5>\n<p><strong><a href="https://www.tyron.network/tyrondex.ssi/defix">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ssiprotocol">Twitter</a></strong></p>\n<h5>RESOURCES</h5>\n<p><strong><a href="https://blog.zilliqa.com/tyron-brings-sovereign-identity-to-defi-with-tyrondex/">Zilliqa Network</a></strong></p>\n<h5><span style="color: #ffff99;"><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdACnREL_I_9ZxTj4-6Xu6_kwmIAg4KZmnNHOyn0sIttl2zZw/viewform" style="color: #ffff99;">REQUEST AN ARTICLE</a></strong></span></h5>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smartliquidity.info/2023/09/02/zilliqa-has-introduced-tyrondex/" rel="nofollow">Zilliqa has introduced TyronDEX</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smartliquidity.info" rel="nofollow">Smart Liquidity Research</a>.</p>	55	\N	\N
